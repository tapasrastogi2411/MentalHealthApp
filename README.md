### What it does

It is an app with a very simple user interface that has options to meditate, look at positive quotes, and wholesome memes at the touch of a button. We have also incorporated the option to call the suicide hotline number in case the user is feeling distressed and needs professional help from a human.

We also have daily built-in notifications that remind the user to keep themselves hydrated by drinking water and a positive quote every morning to look at and feel good

### How we built it

We built the app using Android Studio, incorporating Java, and Firebase.

### Challenges we ran into

Nobody in our group knew how to develop android applications before this hackathon. It was a big challenge to learn how Java, Firebase, Kotlin, and Flutter works. As we continued to work on the app, we realized that Kotlin and Flutter were not necessary to use for our app and focused on Java and Firebase in order to decrease the difficulty

### Accomplishments we are proud of

We are very proud of learning Kotlin, Java, Flutter, and Firebase using Android Studio this hackathon, and coming up with a hack that is visually pleasing and applicable in our daily lives. Our app is more relevant now than ever before because of the quarantine and lockdown restrictions we must follow to keep us and our loved ones safe.
